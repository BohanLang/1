# Physarum

A very simple simulation of Physarum polycephalum, with inspiration from [Jeff Jones'](https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/980579) paper and [Sage Jensen's](https://sagejenson.com/physarum) blog. The parameters are very similar to that of the original paper, and the program can be run simply by calling main.py after altering the script to specify the simulation parameters in the scheduler() function. By default, the scheduler will produce a 500-step simulation with a 200x200 grid, 7% population, and particles with: Sensor Offset 9 pixels, Rotation Angle 45 degrees, and Sensor Angle 22.5 degrees. 

Further work would include:

* Optimization
* Video recording process
* Species
* Network damage and repair modeling
* Obstacles, stimuli, hazards in the environment

To Do:
**Separate classes into their own files**
